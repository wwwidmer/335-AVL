=======

Create an Enhanced AVL Tree. 

In this assignment, you will implement an enhanced AVL(EAVL) tree. The EAVL tree differs from an
AVL tree in that it has member variables that store its current height,the number of nodes in the tree (called its size),
and the internal path length of the tree.
It also provides a metho d for rep orting the values of each of these metrics, as well as the numb er of nodes 
visited by finnd operations. Lastly, it has a method to provide the average number of nodes visited in all find
operations so far.
